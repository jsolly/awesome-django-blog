Welcome to the Django Blog App! We welcome contributions from anyone who would like to help improve the app. Before getting started, please take a moment to review this guide to learn about how you can contribute.

## Project Description

The Django Blog App is a fully functional blogging platform built with the Django web framework. It offers features such as blog post and comment management, category creation, and user authentication and authorization. The app is designed to be easily integrated into any existing Django project or used as a standalone app. We hope you find this app useful and welcome any contributions or suggestions for improvement.

## Issue Submission

If you find any bugs, issues or errors while using the app, please submit a new issue through our issue tracker. When submitting an issue, please provide as much information as possible, including the steps to reproduce the issue, the expected behavior, and the actual behavior. We also provide templates for submitting bug reports and feature requests to help you get started.

## Contributions

We welcome any contributions to the project, including bug fixes, feature requests, and general improvements. When contributing, please make sure to follow our coding standards, which include using ruff for code linting and Black for code formatting. Additionally, we suggest using conventional commits for commit messages to maintain consistency in our commit history.

## Testing

We use Pytest and coverage for testing. You can find the tests in the django_project/tests folder. We recommend installing the django-coverage plugin (included in requirements.txt) for more detailed test coverage reporting.
