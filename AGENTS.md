# AGENTS.md

## Stack and structure

Static Astro + Svelte + PagesCMS blog, Node 24. `src/content/posts/*.md` holds
Markdown with YAML frontmatter; category JSON is in `src/content/categories`.
`src/content.config.ts` validates metadata and uses file paths as loader IDs, so
`src/lib/content.ts` sees and rejects all duplicate post/category slugs before
filtering drafts. `src/lib/html.ts` sanitizes rendered
HTML and preserves the original heading fragment algorithm. Keep that behavior.

Astro builds public routes in `src/pages`. Svelte handles navigation, GET search
and query pagination. Client data must contain published posts only. Assets are
bundled or first-party; no CDN runtime CSS/JS. Existing S3/CloudFront article media
remains public. Do not introduce database/auth/AI backends without a new scope decision.

`.pages.yml` uses a Markdown code editor, structured metadata, new-post draft
labels and `settings.content.merge: true` to preserve unmanaged reconciliation keys.
Timestamps use validated ISO strings to preserve seconds, precision and timezones;
the cover image uses a URL/media-path string with uploads through the Media sidebar.
Do not replace the body with WYSIWYG without a verified complex-article roundtrip.
Legacy slugs are case-sensitive and stable. Preserve author names, timestamps,
excerpts and related links. CommonMark is configured without smart punctuation or
GFM autolinking; complex authored HTML is retained and sanitized.

## Frontend stack

Astro owns pages and content; Svelte owns interactive islands. Use the installed
shadcn-svelte controls for new or replaced standard UI controls, loading the
shared `/shadcn-svelte` skill. Navigation and search use the generated Button and
Input sources in `src/lib/components/ui`. Import the defining `.svelte` file
directly. `components.json` and the `$lib` paths support the pinned local CLI.
`src/styles/ui.css` maps UI utilities to the existing site theme without a
Tailwind preflight reset; source scanning is limited to the UI component directory
and the navigation/search sources. Preserve authored article styling and recipe workflows.

## Commands

Commands run from `/Users/johnsolly/code/awesome-blog`.

```bash
npm ci
npx --no-install playwright install chromium
npm run gate
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run preview
```

`npm run gate:app` checks Astro/Svelte, builds, runs content/route contracts and
proves a real draft's content and slug are absent from all built assets and routes,
rejects identical duplicate post/category files, then restores the normal build.
`npm run gate` additionally checks secrets, Bash, YAML, Actions, Markdown and
read-only production-smoke contracts. It validates the full working tree even with
an empty index. It needs the installed dotagents gate library, Bash 5, actionlint,
gitleaks and pinned Node dependencies. Use `npm run worktree:init` for fresh checkouts.
Never set `core.hooksPath`; the trusted dotagents dispatcher owns it.

The importer `scripts/import-legacy.mjs` writes only to an empty destination.
`npm run verify:migration -- .migration-work/source-2026-10-02.json` compares the
actual build against the private authoritative source; its source oracle must not
use the application's converter or renderer. Private export evidence stays ignored.
Git history keeps legacy code; ignored SQLite, virtualenv and media state is retained.

## Ship and release

Ship profile: `vercel-static`.

Integration is branch → PR → merge on green `CI / ci`. Start new work from freshly
fetched `origin/main`. Every remote push and PR runs through `/ship`; never push
`main`, edit rulesets, admin-merge, or arm automatic previews. CI retains exact-tree
proof; manual CI runs always validate. Dependabot remains deferred until a manually
invoked drain adds `ow-ci`; skipped checks cannot satisfy `ci`.

Canonical production URL: <https://www.blogthedata.com>. Vercel production branch
is `main`, install `npm ci`, build `npm run build`, output `dist`, Node 24.
`vercel.json` disables other Git refs and supplies redirects/security/feed MIME.
Vercel project `blogthedata` deploys GitHub repository `jsolly/awesome-blog` from
protected `main`; project previews are disabled and deployment protection remains
enabled. Canonical production serves the static site over valid HTTPS. Every
release must match its full SHA and pass canonical Production smoke. Heroku
automatic deploys are disabled; release v315 and its database/media remain for
recovery. John accepted the cutover and closed the initial rollback window on
October 2, 2026; publishing may resume through PagesCMS editorial branches and PRs.
Follow [the migration runbook](docs/astro-migration.md).

A release requires successful production deployment plus that exact SHA's canonical
production smoke. `/release.json` records `VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA` (CI/local use
`GITHUB_SHA`/Git HEAD). Smoke rejects stale releases before public reading, GET
search, RSS/Atom MIME and mobile navigation. It performs no authenticated writes.
Set the GitHub repository variable `VERCEL_PRODUCTION_ENVIRONMENT` only after
observing the Vercel project's actual production environment. Heroku events are
excluded. Missing, skipped, failed or timed-out smoke is incomplete; dispatch the
workflow on `main` with the full deployed SHA and a unique request ID as fallback.
Record deployment and smoke URLs. Artifacts upload even on failure.

## UI verification

Use the installed `verify-ui` skill and `rules/frontend-verification.md` after
observable changes. Preview: <http://127.0.0.1:4321>, no login. Check desktop and
mobile pixels, console, navigation, pagination, GET search, article reading,
heading links and print. Complex-content changes additionally require recipe table,
code and iframe checks in both viewports. Screenshots/evidence belong in ignored
`.migration-work` or a temporary directory.

## Cloud and data safety

John authorized migration backups and hosting administration. Infrastructure deployment,
production DB writes and destructive cloud changes remain John's human operations. Keep Heroku/database/S3/CloudFront/IAM
resources and independent backups intact until separately authorized retirement.
Cutover acceptance does not authorize teardown. The AWS bucket is
`blogthedata` in account `730335616323`; do not widen the retained bucket-scoped
policy. All new AWS resources must be defined with CloudFormation. The recovery
bucket has been provisioned through CloudFormation and its exact-version database
and media recovery verified; the frontend needs no AWS credentials. Do not delete
ignored exports or local rollback state. See the runbook for independent backups.

Cross-repo rules remain canon in dotagents; this task does not authorize fleet
rollouts or edits in other repositories. Shared recall and fleet policies apply.
