# AGENTS.md

## Stack

Django 5.1 blogging platform on Python 3.13. SQLite by default, Postgres optional. HTMX for partial updates, CKEditor 5 for authoring, OpenAI for chatbot/title generation. WhiteNoise + optional S3/CloudFront for static/media. Deploys via Procfile (Heroku-style).

## Common Commands

All commands run from the repo root with `.venv` activated.

```bash
# First-time setup
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py setup_env          # creates .env from .env.example with a fresh SECRET_KEY
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver

# Tests (pytest, uses tests/base.py SetUp class)
pytest tests                        # full suite
pytest tests/test_views.py          # single file
pytest tests/test_views.py::PostDetailViewTests::test_post_detail_view_uses_correct_template  # single test

# Coverage
coverage run --rcfile=config/.coveragerc -m pytest tests
coverage report -m --skip-covered --rcfile=config/.coveragerc

# Lint / format (ruff config is in config/pyproject.toml, NOT root)
ruff check --config ./config/pyproject.toml app
ruff format app

# Pre-commit hooks (configured under config/, not root)
cd config && pre-commit install

# Seed data — required for many tests since base.py expects existing admin/comment_only users + "uncategorized" category
python manage.py import_posts utilities/seed_posts/posts.json

# Recompute post-similarity embeddings (writes blog/df.pkl)
python manage.py recalculate_post_simularities

# Live reload (optional, set LIVERELOAD=True in .env, run in second terminal)
python manage.py livereload
```

Default seeded accounts: `admin/admin` and `comment_only/comment_only`.

## Architecture

Three Django apps plus a project package:

- **`app/`** — project config. Single-module `settings.py` (not a package; `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=app.settings`). Contains URL root, ASGI/WSGI, custom `WwwRedirectMiddleware`, `storage_backends.py` (S3 variants for public/private/post-image/static), and `sitemaps.py`.
- **`blog/`** — domain core. Models: `Category`, `Post` (CKEditor5 content, ResizedImageField → WEBP), `Comment`. Class-based views in `views.py` cover CRUD, search, status page, and two GPT endpoints (`generate-with-gpt`, `answer-with-gpt`). Post-similarity uses a pickled DataFrame at `blog/df.pkl` produced by the `recalculate_post_simularities` management command — don't regenerate casually.
- **`users/`** — auth views, profile, password reset. Wraps Django's built-in auth views with custom templates.
- **`tests/`** — flat pytest suite at repo root (NOT inside each app). All test classes inherit from `tests.base.SetUp`, which forces `USE_SQLITE=True` / `USE_CLOUD=False` at import time and pre-creates `admin`, `comment_only`, default `uncategorized` category, and a `first_post`/`first_comment`. Use `tests/utils.py` (`create_unique_post`, `create_comment`) instead of building fixtures inline. The `tearDown` deletes all `Post` rows between tests — **don't** assume posts persist across tests.

Key cross-cutting pieces:

- **CSP** is enforced via `django-csp` (`CSP_*` settings in `app/settings.py`). Adding any new external script/style/font/image source requires updating these tuples or it'll be blocked at runtime — symptom is silent breakage in the browser console, not a Django error. `livereload` injects its own CSP entries, gated on `LIVERELOAD=True`.
- **HTML minification** via `django-htmlmin` middleware runs on every response — beware when debugging template whitespace issues.
- **Storage** flips entirely on `USE_CLOUD`. With `USE_CLOUD=True`, default/media/static/CKEditor uploads all route through `app/storage_backends.py` to S3; otherwise FileSystemStorage + WhiteNoise. Tests force `USE_CLOUD=False` regardless of `.env`.
- **CKEditor 5 image uploads** depend on `CSRF_COOKIE_HTTPONLY` staying `False` (commented out in settings with a note). Don't enable it.
- **Status page** (`/status/`) is cached for 60s via `cache_page`; the project uses `LocMemCache` so cache is per-process — fine for single-dyno Heroku, surprising in tests.
- **GPT chatbot** loads `blog/df.pkl` (post embeddings) into memory. Files in `utilities/create_embeddings/` build it; the management command refreshes it.

## Conventions

- Ruff config (`config/pyproject.toml`) ignores `E402`, `E501`, `F403` and excludes `apps.py` / `*/settings/*`. Don't fight those rules — they exist for Django-specific patterns (settings star-imports, top-of-file `setup()` calls in tests, intentionally long lines).
- Test convention: flat `tests/test_<module>.py` mirroring the source module, classes inheriting `SetUp` from `tests/base.py`.
- This is a personal project. No PRs; the `/review-fix-push` skill is the review gate. Conventional Commits (`feat(blog): …`, `fix(users): …`).
- CI's test step is currently commented out in `.github/workflows/django-test-deploy-master.yaml`. Run tests locally before pushing.

## Global Rules

The block below is synced from `~/.agents/AGENTS.md` by `sync-global-agents.sh`. Don't hand-edit between the markers — changes will be overwritten on next sync. Add project-specific rules above this block.

<!-- BEGIN GLOBAL RULES (managed by sync-global-agents.sh) -->
## Family Memory

When the family-memory MCP is available, call `recall` (no args) at conversation start to load context about the user. Use `remember` to store notable new facts, preferences, or events that come up naturally.

## Collaboration

- No pull requests for personal projects. `/review-fix-push` skill is the sole review gate — reviews local changes against remote, fixes issues, commits and pushes.
- Custom skills live at `~/.agents/skills/` (e.g., `~/.agents/skills/review-fix-push/SKILL.md`), not `.claude/plugins/`.
- `~/.cursor/skills/` and `~/.claude/skills/` must be **real directories** (not symlinks to `~/.agents/skills/`). The `npx skills add` installer stores content in `~/.agents/skills/<name>/` then creates per-skill symlinks from each agent dir — directory-level symlinks cause circular links.
- Family/domain knowledge lives in the family-memory MCP, not in flat files.

## User Context

Software engineer turned Sr. Director at Leidos (Health-IT under DIGMOD). I use this chat to think through ideas, explore topics, write code, and have real conversations.

When exploring ideas, be discursive and collaborative — follow the thread wherever it goes, even if it gets uncomfortable. Steel-man arguments, don't lecture. When I'm vague, call it out directly. When my logic doesn't hold up, say so. I'd rather be challenged than reassured. I value extreme bluntness, the proactive surfacing of things I haven't considered, and getting closer to the truth over reaching a comfortable answer.

## Conversation Preferences

- **Ask when ambiguous.** If there's one obvious approach, just do it. If there are meaningful tradeoffs or multiple paths, stop and ask.
- **Layered questions.** Ask the 2-3 most critical questions first, start on what's clear, then follow up as you go.
- **Present options with a recommendation.** "Here are approaches X, Y, Z. I'd recommend Y because..." — then wait.
- **Brief rationale.** A sentence or two on the "why" is enough. Don't belabor it.
- **Casual and direct.** Like a coworker on Slack. No hedging, no filler.
- **Do what I asked, but flag concerns.** If you think the approach has issues, implement it and note the concern — don't silently diverge.
- **Update at the end.** Show the result when done. Only interrupt mid-task if blocked.
- **Proactively improve adjacent code.** If you see something nearby that could be better, clean it up. Prefer deep refactoring over preserving backwards compatibility.
- **Concise responses.** Short, dense with information. I can ask for more detail.
- **When uncertain, ask.** Don't guess at project conventions, intent, or technical details — even if it slows things down.
