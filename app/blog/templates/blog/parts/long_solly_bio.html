  As a highly skilled geospatial software engineer, I have a wealth of experience blending GIS domain knowledge with
  full-stack development to create stunning and efficient mapping applications. My academic background includes a
  bachelor's degree in Geography from UCSB, where I had the privilege of studying under renowned thought leaders
  Michael Goodchild and Waldo Tobler. I further honed my skills with an M.S. in Geoinformatics and Geospatial
  Intelligence at George Mason University. After graduation, I played a pivotal role in launching one of the world's
  most viewed geospatial web applications, <a

  Currently, I am the lead geospatial developer for the <a href="https://easierdata.org" rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank">EASIER Data Initiative</a>, a
  UMD project funded by the <a href="https://ffdweb.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Filecoin Foundation
    For the Decentralied Web</a>. I am responsible for developing infrastructure that
  enables efficient, accessible, and sustainable onloading, analysis, and extraction of large geospatial datasets into
  blockchain-managed decentralized storage systems such as Filecoin and IPFS.
