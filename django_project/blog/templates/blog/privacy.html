  <p>How data is collected on this site</p>
  <p>
    I collect IP addresses via server logs when a request is made to any page on
    my domain. I then geocode them using a service called IPinfo and place them on
    a map which is displayed in the
    <a href="https://blogthedata.com/post/web-mapping-gallery/">map gallery</a>.
    According to IPInfo's
    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ipinfo.io/blog/ip-geolocation-accuracy">geolocation
      accuracy page</a>:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    While IP addresses can't be used to track individuals, they're very accurate
    when it comes to identifying countries, regions (such as states), cities, or
    postal codes. As you might expect, broader areas, such as countries, are
    easier to identify than specific cities.

  <p>
    I don't use Google Analytics, but do use a CDN (Cloudflare) so check their

    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/">privacy policy</a>
    to see what information they collect.
