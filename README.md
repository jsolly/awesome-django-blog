## Installation

```shell
# first install Python 3.10.x (have not tested newer versions, but they could work)
git clone https://github.com/jsolly/awesome-django-blog.git
cd awesome-django-blog
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Development

First, rename 'awesome-django-blog/sample.env' to .env and change the values to match your setup.
   (database passwords, secret keys, etc)

By default USE_SQLITE is set to `true` if you want to use something else like postgres, set this to False and modify the DJANGO_DB_SETTINGS variable in the file.

```shell
cd awesome-django-blog/django_project
python3 manage.py runserver
```

### Configure Django Sites Framework

1 - Run the server and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/sites

2 - Add a new site with the following values: - Domain name: 127.0.0.1:8000 - Display name: 127.0.0.1:8000

Here is a screenshot of my sites configuration:

3 - Now go into your settings.dev file and change the SITE_ID to the ID of the site you just created. It should be 1 if you have yet to create any other sites.

### Coverage

```shell
coverage run --rcfile=config/.coveragerc -m pytest django_project
coverage report -m --skip-covered --rcfile=config/.coveragerc
```

### Tests

```shell
pytest django_project
```

### Linting

```shell
ruff --config ./config/pyproject.toml django_project
```

### Formating

```shell
black --config ./config/pyproject.toml django_project
```

Also see the [actions tab](https://github.com/jsolly/awesome-django-blog/actions)
to see if everything is passing.

### Pre-commit Hooks

If there are any Ruff failures (badly linted code), the build will fail, so please make sure you have the pre-commit hook installed.

```
$ cd awesome-django-blog/config
$ pre-commit install
```

### Local server (For mobile testing)
