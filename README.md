# blogthedata.com

Welcome to my Django blog app! This app is a fully functional blogging platform that I built using the Django web framework. It includes features such as creating and managing blog posts, comments, and categories, as well as user authentication and authorization. The app is designed to be easily integrated into any existing Django project or can be used as a standalone app. In this readme, you will find instructions for installation, configuration, and usage that I have provided. I have also included information about the app's features and troubleshooting tips that I have gathered. I hope you find this app useful and I welcome any contributions or suggestions for improvement.

## Installation

```shell
# first install Python 3.10.x (have not tested newer versions, but they could work)
$ git clone https://github.com/jsolly/blogthedata.git
$ python3 -m venv blogthedata/django_project/venv
$ source blogthedata/django_project/venv/bin/activate
$ pip install --upgrade pip
$ python3 -m pip install -r blogthedata/django_project/requirements/requirements.txt -c blogthedata/django_project/requirements/constraints.txt
```

## Setup

### Database

1. See commented out Database section in
   [django_project/settings/dev.py](https://github.com/jsolly/blogthedata/blob/master/django_project/django_project/settings/dev.py)
   to use sqllite database or postgres. If you're on MacOS, there's a really handy app called [postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/)

```shell
$ sudo -U postgres psql
postgres=# CREATE USER blogthedatauser WITH PASSWORD 'password';
postgres=# ALTER ROLE blogthedatauser SET client_encoding TO 'utf8';
postgres=# ALTER ROLE blogthedatauser SET default_transaction_isolation TO 'read committed';
postgres=# ALTER ROLE blogthedatauser SET timezone TO 'UTC';
postgres=# CREATE DATABASE blogthedata WITH OWNER blogthedatauser;
postgres=# \c blogthedata
postgres=# CREATE extension postgis;
postgres=# SELECT PostGIS_version();
# type <exit> and hit enter to go back to the terminal
$ python3 manage.py migrate
```

2. rename 'sample.env' to .env and change the values to match your setup
   (database passwords, secret keys, etc)

```shell
$ python3 manage.py runserver
```

### Coverage

```shell
$ coverage run -m pytest django_project
$ coverage report -m --skip-covered
```

### Test

```shell
$ psql -U postgres
postgres=# CREATE DATABASE blogthedata_test WITH OWNER blogthedatauser;
postgres=# \c blogthedata_test
postgres=# CREATE extension postgis;
postgres=# SELECT PostGIS_version();
# type <exit> and hit enter to go back to the terminal
$ python3 blogthedata/django_project/manage.py migrate
$ python3 -m pytest django_project
```

### Lint

```shell
$ flake8 django_project
```

Also see the [actions tab](https://github.com/jsolly/blogthedata/actions)
to see if everything is passing.

### Pre-commit Hooks (Optional as the CI also takes care of it)

```
$ cd blogthedata
$ chmod +x run_tests.sh
$ pre-commit install
```

### Local server (For mobile testing)

[Use Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)
