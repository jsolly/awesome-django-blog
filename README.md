# blogthedata.com

Welcome to my Django blog app! This app is a fully functional blogging platform that I built using the Django web framework. It includes features such as creating and managing blog posts, comments, and categories, as well as user authentication and authorization. The app is designed to be easily integrated into any existing Django project or can be used as a standalone app. In this readme, you will find instructions for installation, configuration, and usage that I have provided. I have also included information about the app's features and troubleshooting tips that I have gathered. I hope you find this app useful and I welcome any contributions or suggestions for improvement.

## Installation

```shell
# first install Python 3.10.x (have not tested newer versions, but they could work)
$ git clone https://github.com/jsolly/blogthedata.git
$ python3 -m venv blogthedata/django_project/venv
$ source blogthedata/django_project/venv/bin/activate
$ pip install --upgrade pip
$ python3 -m pip install -r blogthedata/django_project/requirements/requirements.txt -c blogthedata/django_project/requirements/constraints.txt
```

## Setup

### Development/Production Database

1. See commented out Database section in
   [django_project/settings/dev.py](https://github.com/jsolly/blogthedata/blob/master/django_project/django_project/settings/dev.py)
   to use sqllite database or postgres. If you're on MacOS, there's a really handy app called [postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/)

```shell
$ sudo service postgreSQL start # If you're on Linux (Open postgres.app if you're on MacOS)
$ sudo -U postgres psql
postgres=# CREATE USER <username> WITH PASSWORD '<password>;
postgres=# ALTER ROLE <username> SET client_encoding TO 'utf8';
postgres=# ALTER ROLE <username> SET default_transaction_isolation TO 'read committed';
postgres=# ALTER ROLE <username> SET timezone TO 'UTC';
postgres=# CREATE DATABASE <database_name> WITH OWNER <username>;
postgres=# \c <database_name>
# type <exit> and hit enter to go back to the terminal
$ python3 manage.py migrate --settings=django_project.settings.prod # or dev
```

2. rename 'blogthedata/config/sample.env' to .env and change the values to match your setup
   (database passwords, secret keys, etc)

```shell
$ python3 manage.py runserver
```

### Local Testing Database
```shell
$ sudo service postgreSQL start # If you're on Linux (Open postgres.app if you're on MacOS)
$ sudo -U postgres psql
postgres=# CREATE USER dummy_user WITH PASSWORD 'dummy_password';
postgres=# ALTER ROLE dummy_user SET client_encoding TO 'utf8';
postgres=# ALTER ROLE dummy_user SET default_transaction_isolation TO 'read committed';
postgres=# ALTER ROLE dummy_user SET timezone TO 'UTC';
postgres=# CREATE DATABASE dummy_db WITH OWNER dummy_user;
postgres=# \c dummy_db
# type <exit> and hit enter to go back to the terminal
$ python3 manage.py migrate --settings=django_project.settings.ci
```
```
### Run Test Coverage

```shell
$ coverage run --data-file=coverage/.coverage --rcfile=config/.coveragerc -m pytest django_project 
$ coverage report --data-file=coverage/.coverage -m --skip-covered --rcfile=config/.coveragerc 
```

### Run Tests

```shell
$ pytest django_project
```

### Lint Code

```shell
$ ruff --config ./config/pyproject.toml django_project
```

### Format Code

```shell
$ black --config ./config/pyproject.toml django_project
```

Also see the [actions tab](https://github.com/jsolly/blogthedata/actions)
to see if everything is passing.


### Pre-commit Hooks
If there are any Ruff failures (badly linted code), the build will fail, so ensure you have the pre-commit hook installed.

```
$ cd blogthedata/config
$ pre-commit install
```

### Local server (For mobile testing)

[Use Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)
